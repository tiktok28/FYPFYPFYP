5. Take the protractor and place it on top of the prism and invert it so that the flat edge is facing the direction of which the ray is being refracted.
6. Measure the angle between the normal and the angle of the refracted ray and write it down.
7. Place the respective values into their places in the formula of: n1∙ sin θ1 = n2∙ sin θ2
8. In this example, the formula will become 1.00 ∙ sin(43.9) = n2∙ sin(27.5)
9. Rearrange the formula to get the refractive index of the medium:
n2 = ((1.00 ∙ sin(43.9)) ÷ sin(27.5))
n2 = 1.5
