Refraction

The following experiment discusses how the passage of light through a boundary between two mediums leads to alterations in both the speed and wavelength of the wave. This alteration can cause a change in the light's direction at the boundary, a phenomenon referred to as refraction. In this particular experiment, the goal is to quantify the change in the direction of light beams as they undergo refraction or reflection at a boundary, ultimately aiming to ascertain the index of refraction of a transparent object.
