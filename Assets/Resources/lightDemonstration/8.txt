To demonstrate the experiment, the experiment will be setup in this manner:

1. Place the prism at an appropriate distance.
2. Place the laser at a certain angle and activate the laser beam.
3. Take the protractor and lay the flat edge on the prism face that is being hit by the laser.
4. Measure the angle between the normal and the angle of the incident ray and write it down.
