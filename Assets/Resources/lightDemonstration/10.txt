For the purposes of this VR application, you are simply required to record down the angles of incident and refraction. Calculation will be handled by the system.

Do not worry of not having an accurate answer. The system will handle a degree of your approximation and assess how accurate you are to the correct answer.

With that in mind, good luck with your assessment!
