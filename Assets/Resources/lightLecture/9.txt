-Color and Dispersion:
The formation of colors is a remarkable aspect of our curriculum. Light is composed of various colors, and when it passes through a prism, it disperses into its constituent colors. This dispersion is the reason we see beautiful rainbows in the sky.

Understanding color and dispersion is essential for our studies and provides a foundation for grasping the principles of optics, color theory, and spectroscopy.
